# Password_Generator

Is a project dedicated to generate passwords for employees when they specify their unique characters. 

## How it works

When the user visits the site, and they hit the generate password button. The user is then prompted by a welcome message.

The user will then be greeted by a prompt to type in the specific characters and length of their password. After the user specifies this a new prompt will be shown.

The user then gets asked a few more questions which include if they want numbers in their password and/or symbols.
